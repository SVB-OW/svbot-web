# ToDo's

Features or changes that are planned for the future ordered by priority.

- [x] Second row in /chooseRank to select the rank of the enemy team

- [x] Allow stacking of handicaps / bounties
- [x] Upgrade to Nuxt 3 / Vue 3
- [ ] Allow DB to be changed via ENV
- [ ] Use single port for both server and client
- [ ] Additional templates for streamers (icons, handicap list, list with explanation)
- [ ] View-Only Mode: Add fixed key auth in URL to enable/prevent interaction with the page
- [ ] Serve single spa route that updates the view for everyone
  - [ ] Combine /, /chooseRank and /chooseHandicaps into one page, so everyone can see the current interactions and make screen sharing redundant
- [ ] Maybe look into changing the website to look less backend-y and better in general
  - [ ] Maybe style input fields and buttons to match theme
  - [ ] Clean up font sizes and colors a bit
  - [ ] Leaderboard could look better
  - [ ] Input and buttons could be hidden on the leaderboard page
  - [ ] Rank icons should scale to viewport size on /chooseRank
  - [ ] Rank selection could also be an option on /chooseHandicaps, so that the streamer doesn't have to navigate pages to show the streamer the differences between ranks
