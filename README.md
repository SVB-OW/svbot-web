# SVBot Web

> **Warning**
> This project has been archived, because the git history contains secrets and hard coded values, which I tried to remove retroactively, but can't be certain. The new project can be found here: <https://github.com/SVB-OW/svbot-web>

This will be the web interface used for SVB's The Ranked Gauntlet

## Stack

Vue in Nuxt because I prefer Vue over React and Svelte has proven to be
premature.

The database is MongoDB and will be the same as the SVBot uses.
